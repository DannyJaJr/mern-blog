        `React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library
         for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual 
         developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. 
         However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications
          usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.Wikipedia source`

       `JavaScrip often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
       JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based 
       object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
       Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device. Wikipedia source.

       `Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and 
       open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been 
       called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
       The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server,
        meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. 
        Express is the back-end component of popular development stacks like the MEAN, MERN or MEVN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and a 
        JavaScript front-end framework or library. wikipedia source`
